===============

This right here is my "Masters of Doom" inspired attempt at a canvas-based Javascript raycaster. The idea is to keep it working
at 640x480 @ 60 FPS, while steadily adding the features I deem most fun to implement. 

If you want to try it, just opening 'index.html' should work. If you run it from the filesystem, Chrome will complain about
security (as usual) - you'll have to use an HTTP server or another browser.
