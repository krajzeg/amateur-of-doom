===============

This right here is my "Masters of Doom" inspired attempt at a canvas-based Javascript raycaster. The idea is to keep it working
at 640x480 @ 60 FPS, while steadily adding the features I deem most fun to implement. 

[Try it right here on Github!](http://krajzeg.github.io/amateur-of-doom)

If you want to play with it locally, don't run it from the filesystem - your browser will complain about
security. You'll have to set up an HTTP server to serve this.
